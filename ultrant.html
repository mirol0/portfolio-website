                                <p>
                                    I utilize Design Thinking Process when solving a design problem, which required me to complete competitive analysis and conduct user interviews. Based on this research, I prioritized high-priority needs
                                    and test my hypothesis. At this point, I created a high-fidelity design, tested the prototype, and continued refining my design by building iterations based on user feedback. Below is a design strategy I
                                    created that sums up my design process.

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                For this design brief, the main objective was to help people save money by creating a mobile personal finance app that is motivation and accessible, both in terms of tech-ability and cross-platform use.
                                Knowing personal finance can be a prickly area for many people, I wanted to utilize a very friendly and inviting interface that made feel comfortable and accomplished for creating and sticking to their
                                financial goals.

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                I conducted research on 2 major competitors in the personal-finance space: Ellevest and Mint. Both brands had traits that inspired me. Ellevest, seen below on the left, has a professional, yet conversational
                                design language that infuses trust into every task. While, Mint, on the other hand, relies on a soothing, cool blue color and easy to understand onboarding information to ensure quick comprehension. I knew
                                these were elements I wanted my app to possess as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The next phase of my research required me to investigate the ideal user. The design brief provided ample information about the target user and their motivations, which helped steer me towards finding my
                                design star. For this design I focused on 3:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>As a new user, I need to be able to create a profile, so that the financial advice I receive is personalized to me, my spending habits, and tailored to my goals.</li>
                                <li>As a user, I want the money-saving tool I use to be motivational, so that I stay on track with my goals.</li>
                                <li>As a user, I want to receive a personalized savings plan, so that I can save enough money to reach my goal in time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                With these stories in mind, I conducted interviews (12 total) to determine other motivations and pain points users experience. I quickly found there was space in the market for the kind of tool I was
                                envisioning; one where you can easily input your information and organize it into goals, too, and along the way you'll be supported in a creative, confident voice. Enter Ultrant: your personalized
                                motivational tool for personal saving goals. This tool is designed to be used by ANY and EVERYone, so we can all achieve our msot fabulous saving goals.
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <h4>User Personas</h4>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                I took my findings and compiled them into 2 composite user personas that I relied on to focus on the needs and behaviors of the user. One persona reflects a new user, who struggles more with tech, and the
                                other is a little more knowledgeable, but is intimidated of personal finance.
                            </p>

                            <p>Building further upon the user stories and personas, I created a site map in order to visualize the information hierarchy and provide structure for the app.</p>
                            <div>
                                <picture class="img">

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The word accessible was emphasized in the design brief. I decided I wanted the design to be accessible in many ways; from how it is accessed and how the information is absorbed. I wanted to combine the calm,
                                professional tone of the fintech industry with the warm and friendly illustrations and casual, creative tone of a mental-health and wellness-type brand. Enter ultrant: the personalized motivational tool for

                            <p>Knowing the motivational tone of the app is the functionality that sets it apart from competitors, I decided to prioritize this task for for this iteration, as part of my design strategy.</p>

                                At this stage, I took my user personas and user flow to begin designing the screens. Initially, paper and pen are used to draw quick low-fidelity wireframes that can be adapted easily.

                                After those feel strong, it is time to transfer them digitally.I used Balsamiq to create initial versions of mid-fidelity wireframes.

                                At this stage of the design project, it was time to focus on creating that positive, creative, supportive tone that feels inclusive and instills trust. Consumer Affairs reports that only 20% of consumers
                                prefer a visit to a physical bank over a digital experience. Another statistic states that over half of Americans delay making financial decisions. What this says is there are a lot of individuals looking to
                                have a positive experience with their personal finance tool, and they need a little guidance in making decisions to save and invest their money properly.

                                With my mid-fidelity wireframes completed, I turned to inVision to create prototypes. My 8-person sample size completed 4 tasks I created and provided consistent, insightful feedback, which ultimately led to
                                an improved login flow, clearer information hierarchy, and a strong support of this motivational feature. From there, I took the feedback and incorporated it in the high fidelity versions.

                            <p>Below is a sample of the user feedback and next iteration wireframes.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>This is the first thing users see after creating a login. Knowing users are not yet familiar with the interface it is extremely
                               important to be as clear and helpful as possible in guiding them through the process. This feature is fairly common
                              among fintech apps, and one that is highly valuabe, which is why I felt it was necessary to dedicate a user flow to it.</p>

                                Being very clear on the design strategy helped the rest of this design fall into place easily later. I also think having an essential flow, or MVP, was a great strategy in the design process in order to
                                prioritize the positive UX/UI experience. Throughout this process I learned to be more organized with documentation and handoff and more iterative in my design process.
