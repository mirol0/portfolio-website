                            </div>
                            <p>Create a native app for both iOS and Android that solves a common problem in the mountain biking community: a significant need for an information hub.</p>
                            <span>GOAL</span>
                            <p>
                                The main goals for this project were to understand the mountain bike industry and what exists in the space, and then create an engaging product that benefits the target user. I relied on my husband and his
                                coworks at The Pro's Closet, a Boulder, CO bike company, for research materials and feedback.
                            </p>
                            <span>ROLE</span>
                            <p>
                                As the sole UX/UI designer, I conducted through research on mountain bike-related apps, and created a competitive analysis of to large indirect competitors. From there, I applied human-centered design
                                thinking principles to create a design solution. I created rapid prototypes, using pen and paper and later, Adobe XD, to test and refine my design along the way.
                            </p>
                            <span>RESULT</span>
                            <p>
                                The result is a final product that understands its strengths. The personalized features are what set it apart from other similar apps, and this focus on easing pain points makes it accessbile engaging for
                                mountain bikers.

                            <p>
                                While a lot of content exists for biking generally-speaking, I was surprised at just how little is out there for <em>mountain</em> biking. That is why I chose to do a competitive analyis with indirect
                                competitors, like Trailforks and MTB Project.
                            </p>

                                With a better understanding of what currently exists in the app space, it was now time to talk with mountain bikers directly. For this, I relied on 3 employees of The Pro's Closet, a local bike company where
                                I live, for industry insight and possible pain points. I also recruited two more recreational mountain bikers.

                                The guys in the industry highlighted a few key things. One, riders are looking for more targeted content, especially around caring for their bike. A specific app like this doesn't yet exist, so by creating
                                personalized bike maintenance information in an app has the potential to be extremely valuable to this community. Here is a look at my design overview. It starts with my overall mission for this design and
                                ends with the specific details used in the current iteration.

                                After reseearch is complete, it's time to start designing! Here is the initial sketch of the home screen, bike maintenance question, and results page for iOS and Android respectively.

                            <p>
                                Once the initial app flows are mapped out on paper, I converted them to Adobe XD to create the low-fidelity wireframes. My priority for this design iteration was to create a personalized questionnaire that
                                provides users with information about their bike and how to service it. Again, it was very important to use standard design practices for gestures, like the toggles you see on the quiz screens below.
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <picture class="img">
                                    <source srcset="img/traverse/low_fi_quiz_@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)" />
                                    <img src="img/traverse/low_fi_quiz_@2x.png" alt="low fidelity" />

                            <p>
                                Before I created high-fidelity wireframes, it was important to get feedback. The next thing I did was export my screens to inVision to create quick prototypes. From there, 8 people completed the test. Through
                                this process, I realized my toggle and progress meters were confusing, and they were both designed out in the high-fidelity version. Here are some different versions of the troubleshooting questionnaire I
                                played around with in this phase.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Multiple rounds of testing provided the feedback I needed to meet my design objectives, but in the end I think they were achieved; the information hierarchy is clear, the user flows are simple, and there is
                                valuable content for the ideal user.

                                This process taught me a lot. I am so grateful for the collaboration I had on this project, and the opportunity to create for both iOS and Android platforms simultaneously. Here is the style guide I created
                                that reflects the minimal,fun, outdoor design for my mountain bike crowd.

                                This project taught me a lot about design language. I enjoyed working with Materal Design more than I thought I would! Additionally, I learned a lot about the bike community in Boulder, where I live, and how
                                to plug in better with interviewees.

                            <p>Consistency between the two languages presented a challenge at times, but continuous feedback really helped me get through. I learned to improve my design speed by utilizing UI Kits as well.</p>
