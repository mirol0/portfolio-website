                                The big picture with Sous Chef was to join the home-cooking revolution by designing an all-star responsive web app for recipes that helps users in the kitchen and on-the-go. But, to put it simply, there are
                                oodles of options out there for folks to get their recipes, make lists, or find a dinner recipe that's ready in under 30 minutes. My job was to design a tool that makes the whole pocess of deciding what to
                                eat, shoopping for it, and eating it a treat! Sous Chef is a responsive web for recipes, making import easier than ever to have your recipes sync up with all your devices, whether you're out for groceries or
                                stirring the kettle, Sous Chef is there.

                                    A Deep Dive Into What's Working v. What's Not.

                            </div>

                                My hypothesis meant to discover if others found all the text-heavy recipe blogs out there as overwhelming as I do. I didn't want to create just one more tool to bookmark, and eventually forget, about recipes.
                                I wanted to see if there was a way to make the tools people already use more useful. I surveyed 11 users for my research to get a closer look at this frustratingly common issue. Below is a sample question and
                                answer set from the initual user interview survey:

                                <li><p>Nope</p></li>
                                <li><p>I wish it would combine with my grocery lists in my iPhone notes. And I hate scrolling so if the recipe and ingredients were better organized that would help.</p></li>
                                <li><p>When they have a long blog before the recipe. I hate having to scroll all the way down.</p></li>

                                Wih my research complete, I took the information I had and created user personas and user flows in order to help direct the design solution and act as a foundation for the prototypes. Now, at this stage, I
                                started rapid prototyping. Creating quick drawings with pen and paper and uploading them to Marvel allowed me to make edits easily and re-test right away. I received thoughtful feedback from 8 participants on
                                my low-fidelity wireframes, which led to a key improvement. As previously stated, text-heavy blogs are difficult to navigate, so what Sous Chef can do is swipe back and forth from ingredients to instructions,
                                and with the user feedback I received, I added an arrow to make the swipe function clearer.

                                Next up: creating a mobile-frst design and a visual identity. The idea behind this strategy is to make the design look good at the smallest platform size and scale it up, so the design looks crisp and
                                consistent at all breakpoints.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The visual identity for Sous Chef is fun and calming, with relaxing shapes. I debated doing a punchier, brighter color scheme, but again with user A/B testing, I decided to stick with the original plan and am
                                very pleased with how it turned out. Below is the style guide for Sous Chef.

                                Creating a consistent scalable design that is visually appealing at every breakpoint can be tricky. In the case of this project, however, I had a firm grasp on the visual identity, and I was able to execute
                                my vision for it from the beginning. Here is the final product of my web responsive app for recipes!

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                This project taught me a lot, and I had a really great, albeit challenging time working on the responsive design aspect. Another major thing I learned was just how random design inspiration can be, and that
                                it is truly important to budget time to just look at the world around you. The idea for the shapes and color scheme for this project came to me based on a book cover I glanced at one day.
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <h4>Next Iteration</h4>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The next steps for this project would be to expand testing and functionality. I would like to focus on the grocery list funcion, and eventually have the tool sync up with other devices, so families can share
                                their grocery lists.
