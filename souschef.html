                                I conducted research on several competitors and quickly realized there is room in the market for a tool that not only provides a place to input your financial information and organize it into goals, but also
                                does it in a creative, confident and supportive manner.

                        <p>
                            The next phase of my research required me to investigate the ideal user. The design brief provided ample information about the target user and their motivations. The 3 I focused on for this project design were:
                        </p>
                        <p>- As a new user, I need to be able to create a profile, so that the financial advice I receive is personalized to me, my spending habits, and tailored to my goals.</p>
                        <p>- As a user, I want the money-saving tool I use to be motivational, so that I stay on track with my goals.</p>
                        <p>- As a user, I want to receive a personalized savings plan, so that I can save enough money to reach my goal in time.</p>
                        <p>
                            With these stories in mind, I conducted some interviews to determine other motivations and pain points users experience. Then, with the help of the tool UXPressia, I created personas as a visual inspiration, and
                            as a reminder as to who this service is targeting.

                                The word accessible was emphasized in the design brief. I decided I wanted the design to be accessible in many ways; from how it is accessed and how the information is absorbed. I wanted to combine the calm,
                                professional tone of the fintech industry with the warm and friendly illustrations and casual, creative tone of a mental-health and wellness-type brand. Enter ultrant: the personalized motivational tool for
                                personal money saving goals. It is a tool designed for anyone and everyone because we all deserve to achieve our most fabulous goals.
                            </p>
                            <p>Knowing the motivational tone of the app is the functionality that sets it apart from competitors, I decided to prioritize this task for for this iteration, as part of my design strategy.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                At this stage, I take my user personas and user flow to begin designing the screens. Initially, paper and pen are used to draw quick low-fidelity wireframes that can be adapted easily. After those feel
                                strong, it is time to transfer them digitally. I used Balsamiq to create initial versions of mid-fidelity wireframes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With my mid-fidelity wireframes completed, I turned to inVision to create prototypes, My 8 person sample size, made up of members of my social and professional networks, tested the prototypes and provided
                                consistent feedback that the log in flow needed some clarification, as well as the information hierarchy, but the basic design made sense and there was an apparent need for this motivational feature to exist.
                                Below is a sample of the user analysis. From there, I took the feedback and utilized it in the high fidelity versions.

                                At this stage of the design project, it was time to focus on creating that positive, creative, supportive tone that feels inclusive and instills trust. Consumer Affairs reports that only 20% of consumers
                                prefer a visit to a physical bank over a digital experience. Another statistic states that over half of Americans delay making financial decisions.What this says to me is there are a lot of individuals
                                looking to have a positive experience with their personal finance tool, and they need a little guidance in making decisions to save and invest their money properly.

                                Being very clear on the design strategy helped the rest of this design fall into place easily later. I also think having an essential flow, or MVP, was a great strategy in the design process in order to
                                prioritize the positive UX/UI experience. Throughout this process I learned to be more organized with documentation and handoff and more iterative in my design process. The next steps for this project would
                                be to expand testing and functionality.
